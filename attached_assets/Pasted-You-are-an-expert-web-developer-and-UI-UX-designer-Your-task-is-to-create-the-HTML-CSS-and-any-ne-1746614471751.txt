You are an expert web developer and UI/UX designer. Your task is to create the HTML, CSS, and any necessary JavaScript for a single-page landing website for a service called "OptimizePrime AI". This service specializes in AI-Powered Landing Page Optimization. Refer to the existing website structure and content (provided below as "Existing Website Structure and Content") and the service package details (provided below as "Service Package Details"). Key Objectives & Enhancements: Modern & Aesthetic Design: The website must have a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic. Use a visually appealing color palette. Consider blues, greens, and teals, often associated with tech and trust, but feel free to suggest a refined palette. Employ high-quality, relevant imagery or abstract graphics that convey AI, data, growth, and optimization. Avoid generic stock photos. Use modern typography with good readability. Ensure clear visual hierarchy. Incorporate subtle animations or transitions to enhance user experience without being distracting. Ensure ample white space for a clean, uncluttered look. Promising & User-Friendly (UX/UI): The website should immediately convey professionalism and build trust. Navigation must be intuitive. A single-page design with a sticky navigation bar linking to sections (e.g., Why Us, Services, Contact) is preferred. Content should be easy to scan and digest. Use clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and concise language. Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons should be prominent, clear, and compelling. The primary CTA should be "Book a Free 15-Min Audit" and a secondary CTA could be "View Our Packages". The website must be fully responsive and look great on all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles). Ensure fast loading times. Optimize images and code. Good SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Implement on-page SEO best practices. The main title tag should be: OptimizePrime AI | AI-Powered Landing Page Conversion Optimization Include relevant meta descriptions for search engines. For example: "Boost your conversions with OptimizePrime AI! We offer expert, AI-driven landing page optimization services to transform your website into a lead-generating machine. Get your free audit today!" Use semantic HTML5 tags (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>). Ensure proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3, etc.). Add alt text to all images for accessibility and SEO. Consider including a small section for "Keywords" or "Tags" in the footer or as meta tags, such as: "landing page optimization, conversion rate optimization, CRO, AI marketing, AI analytics, lead generation, website optimization, A/B testing". Contact Information & Booking Link Integration: The primary contact email address is: tawhid.khondakar18@gmail.com. This should be used for any "Email Us" CTAs or contact information displays. The primary booking link for the "Free 15-Min Audit" and other relevant CTAs is: https://cal.com/tawhid/15min?user=tawhid. This link should open in a new tab. Website Sections (based on existing content, but enhance design and copy where appropriate) : Header: Logo/Brand Name: "OptimizePrime AI" (Design a simple, modern text-based logo or suggest a placeholder for one). Navigation Menu (sticky): Home (Hero), Why Us?, Services (Packages), Contact. Hero Section: Compelling Headline: e.g., "Skyrocket Your Conversions with AI-Powered Landing Page Optimization!" (or suggest an improved, more modern version). Sub-headline: Briefly explain the core benefit. e.g., "Stop leaving money on the table.
